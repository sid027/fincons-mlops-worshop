# MLOps Workshop, 29.11.2023
The workshop introduces basic ideas if MLOps with small hands-on exercises to motivate the topic. The
field of MLOps is vast. The workshop will focus on few major issues and how we deal with them - reproducibility
and traceability. </br>
We will also go into theoretical aspects of deployment infrastructure and the challenges there - since
we did not have access to compute infrastructure, no hands-on work will be done for this part.
